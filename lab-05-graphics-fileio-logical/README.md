# Graphics, File I/0 and Logical Operators Lab

## Why this lab is important
In this lab we'll learn to work with Graphics, File I/O which may both be
necessary for a final project.  We'll also take a look at logical operators 
like shift, and, or and not.

* printBinary.asm
* secrete.asm
* pixelByPixel.asm
* background.asm
* read.asm
* write.asm
* any other in class examples we do together
