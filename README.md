# CS118 Assembly Labs

Welcome to the **CS118 Assembly Labs** repository. This collection comprises various labs and projects completed as part of the CS118 Introduction to Assembly Language course, utilizing MIPS architecture and the MARS IDE.
## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **lab-01-basic-calculator**: Introduction to MIPS assembly with a basic calculator implementation.
- **lab-02-functions**: Exploration of functions and procedures in MIPS assembly.
- **lab-03-fpu-conversions**: Working with floating-point operations and data conversions.
- **lab-04-loops-arrays-io**: Implementation of loops, array manipulations, and input/output operations.
- **lab-05-graphics-fileio-logical**: Graphics handling, file I/O operations, and logical operations in assembly.
- **lab-06-team-final-project**: Collaborative final project showcasing comprehensive skills acquired during the course.

## Getting Started

To explore or run the assembly code in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/edenmese/cs118-assembly-labs.git

2. **Navigate to a Lab Directory**:
   cd cs118-assembly-labs/lab-01-basic-calculator

3. **Open the `.asm` File in MARS**:
   - Download and launch the [MARS IDE](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/).
   - Open the desired `.asm` file within MARS.
   - Assemble and run the program using MARS's interface.
   
   ## Prerequisites

- **MARS IDE**: Ensure you have the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS) installed. [Download MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/).
